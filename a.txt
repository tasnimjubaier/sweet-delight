  5. JavaScript Documentation
  5.1 Overview

JavaScript plays a crucial role in enhancing the interactivity and functionality of the "Sweet Delights" website. It is utilized to create dynamic content, improve user experience, and provide seamless navigation. This section elaborates on how JavaScript is employed to achieve key features of the website and ensures it meets both functional and aesthetic goals.

  5.2 Key JavaScript Features

   Navigation Highlighting
JavaScript dynamically identifies the active page in the navigation bar, providing users with visual feedback on their current location within the website. This improves navigation clarity.

```javascript
function highlightCurrentPage() {
   const currentPage = window.location.pathname.split('/').pop() || 'index.html';
   const navLinks = document.querySelectorAll('.main-nav a');

   navLinks.forEach(link => {
       if (link.getAttribute('href') === currentPage) {
           link.classList.add('active');
       } else {
           link.classList.remove('active');
       }
   });
}
highlightCurrentPage();
```

This function ensures a consistent user experience by emphasizing the current page in the navigation menu.

   Interactive Custom Cake Builder
The custom cake builder is a highlight feature of the website. It allows users to personalize their cakes by choosing options like size, flavor, and decorations. JavaScript dynamically updates the displayed price and description based on the user’s selections.

```javascript
function initializeCakeBuilder() {
   const cakeOptions = {
       size: ['6 inch', '8 inch', '10 inch', '12 inch'],
       flavors: ['Vanilla', 'Chocolate', 'Red Velvet', 'Carrot'],
       decorations: ['Sprinkles', 'Fondant Flowers', 'Custom Text']
   };

   let currentSelection = {
       size: '',
       flavor: '',
       decoration: ''
   };

   Object.keys(cakeOptions).forEach(option => {
       const select = document.getElementById(`cake-${option}`);
       if (select) {
           select.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
               currentSelection[option] = e.target.value;
               updateSummary(currentSelection);
           });
       }
   });

   function updateSummary(selection) {
       const summary = document.getElementById('order-summary');
       summary.textContent = `Your Cake: ${selection.size}, ${selection.flavor}, with ${selection.decoration}`;
   }
}
initializeCakeBuilder();
```

This implementation fosters user engagement and simplifies the customization process.

   Form Validation
Form validation ensures that users provide the necessary information before placing an order. JavaScript checks fields like delivery date, contact details, and special instructions to prevent submission errors.

```javascript
function validateForm() {
   const form = document.getElementById('order-form');
   const name = document.getElementById('customer-name').value;
   const deliveryDate = document.getElementById('delivery-date').value;
   const errorMessage = document.getElementById('error-message');

   form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
       if (!name || !deliveryDate) {
           errorMessage.textContent = 'Please fill in all required fields.';
           e.preventDefault();
       }
   });
}
validateForm();
```

This script ensures that the user experience is smooth while preventing incomplete submissions.

   Responsive Interaction
JavaScript is also used to enhance responsiveness by handling user interactions on smaller screens. For example, the navigation menu toggles visibility in response to user clicks on the menu icon.

```javascript
function initializeMenuToggle() {
   const menuIcon = document.getElementById('menu-icon');
   const navMenu = document.getElementById('nav-menu');

   menuIcon.addEventListener('click', () => {
       navMenu.classList.toggle('visible');
   });
}
initializeMenuToggle();
```

This ensures that the website remains accessible and functional on devices of all sizes.

  5.3 Dynamic Content Updates
JavaScript enables dynamic content updates on the blog page, ensuring that visitors always see the latest articles without needing to refresh the page. An example implementation using asynchronous requests:

```javascript
async function loadBlogPosts() {
   const response = await fetch('/api/blog-posts');
   const posts = await response.json();
   const blogContainer = document.getElementById('blog-container');

   posts.forEach(post => {
       const postElement = document.createElement('div');
       postElement.className = 'blog-post';
       postElement.innerHTML = `<h2>${post.title}</h2><p>${post.excerpt}</p>`;
       blogContainer.appendChild(postElement);
   });
}
loadBlogPosts();
```

This implementation ensures a dynamic and engaging user experience.

  5.4 Error Handling and User Feedback
Providing meaningful error messages is a key aspect of JavaScript functionality. For example:

```javascript
function handleError(error) {
   const errorContainer = document.getElementById('error-container');
   errorContainer.textContent = `An error occurred: ${error.message}`;
   errorContainer.style.display = 'block';
}

try {
   loadBlogPosts();
} catch (error) {
   handleError(error);
}
```

This script ensures users are informed of issues and can proceed with minimal frustration.

  5.5 Future JavaScript Enhancements
To further improve the website’s interactivity and functionality, the following enhancements are planned:

1. **Integration with External APIs**: Adding real-time delivery tracking or customer reviews.
2. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Enabling offline access and faster load times.
3. **Advanced Animations**: Using libraries like GSAP for smoother transitions and animations.

JavaScript remains a vital component in delivering a user-centric, feature-rich website experience.  6. Accessibility Guidelines and Evaluation
